Insecure cryptographic storage occurs when an application doesn’t securely encrypt it’s sensitive data when it is stored into a database. This definition is similar to the picture above, recursive.
Simply stated, insecure cryptographic storage occurs when one of following happens:
   1. The developers don’t encrypt the data that is being stored in the database.
   2. The developers do encrypt the data being stored in the database, but they rely on encryption methods they have developed. (Also known as home-grown cryptography)



    * Identify all sensitive data and encrypt it even when it’s stored on a hard drive
    * Ensure that sensitive data cannot be overwritten
    * Overwrite sensitive memory locations immediately after the data is no longer needed in memory
    * Identify people who should and shouldn’t know secrets
    * Keep secrets such as proprietary algorithms, encryption keys, and DRM even from the administrator
    * Identify sensitive data read into memory, overwrite it with random data, and use strong encryption to safeguard it

  <p>

Cross-Site Request Forgery is a malicious attack where the attacker exploits the user’s Web browser to execute undesired actions on behalf of the user. These actions include:

    * Transferring funds
    * Changing passwords
    * Purchasing items using online shopping

CSRF attacks are effective in a number of situations, including:

    * The victim has an active session on the target site.
    * The victim is authenticated via HTTP auth on the target site.
    * The victim is on the same local network as the target site. 

CSRF has primarily been used to perform an action against a target site using the victim's privileges, but recent techniques have been discovered [5] to disclose information by gaining access to the response. The risk of information disclosure is dramatically increased when the target site is vulnerable to XSS, because XSS can be used as a platform for CSRF, allowing the attack to operate within the bounds of the same-origin policy.
