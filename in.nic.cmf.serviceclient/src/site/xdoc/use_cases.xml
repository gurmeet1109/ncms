			<h2>Use Cases</h2>
			<p>Following use cases describe the componentâ€™s behavior as it responds to a series of related requests from the user.</p>

			<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
			<p><b>Use-Case#1</b></p>
			<p>Description: Allowed a webservice to communicate with another webservice like DataServices want to communicate with SearchApi,DMS.MetadatExtractor,Geotagger etc.</p>
			<p>Actor: Any webservice.</p>
			<p>Pre-condition: In the service.properties file present in service client all the services urls should be present who want to communicate through Serviceclient </p>
			<p>Post-condition: NA</p>
			<p>Basic Flow:</p>
			<blockquote><blockquote>1. DataServices initiates the request to ApplicationFlow.</blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>2. ApplicationFlow initiates the request to Serviceclient. </blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>3. Serviceclient initiates the request to SearchApi,DMS.MetadatExtractor,Geotagger etc, in priority order that is mention in .rf files in ApplicationFlow.</blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>4. Serviceclient returnes the response to ApplicationFlow. </blockquote></blockquote>
                        <blockquote><blockquote>5. ApplicationFlow returnes the response to DataServices. </blockquote></blockquote>

			<!--<p><b>Use-Case#2</b></p>
			<p>Description: Allowed user to create the User with some specific role and details.</p>
			<p>Actor: Any authenticated and authorized user.</p>
			<p>Pre-condition: Authenticated user</p>
			<p>Post-condition: NA</p>
			<p>Basic Flow:</p>
			<blockquote><blockquote>1. User initiates the request to User Management System.</blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>2. User redirected to login if not already logged in. </blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>3. User authenticated and validated with rights.</blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>4. User perforManagement System create new user with some specific role and details on LDAP server and saves. </blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>5. Backend workflow kicks in, determines and controls the movement of data to different underlying components as configured in the workflow process. Rights are checked before processing the request.</blockquote></blockquote>

			<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
			<p><b>Use-Case#3</b></p>
			<p>Description: Allowed user to delete the User. </p>
			<p>Actor: Any authenticated and authorized user.</p>
			<p>Pre-condition: Authenticated user</p>
			<p>Post-condition: NA</p>
			<p>Basic Flow:</p>

		        <blockquote><blockquote>4. User perforManagement System delete the existing user from LDAP server on the basis of User name and saves. </blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>5. Backend workflow kicks in, determines and controls the movement of data to different underlying components as configured in the workflow process. Rights are checked before processing the request.</blockquote></blockquote>

			<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
			<p><b>Use-Case#4</b></p>

			<p>Actor: Any authenticated and authorized user.</p>
			<p>Pre-condition: Authenticated user</p>
			<p>Post-condition: NA</p>
			<p>Basic Flow:</p>
			<blockquote><blockquote>1. User initiates the request to User Management System.</blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>2. User redirected to login if not already logged in. </blockquote></blockquote>
			<blockquote><blockquote>3. User authenticated and validated with rights.</blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>4. User view the user's details from LDAP server and  show to user. </blockquote></blockquote>
		        <blockquote><blockquote>5. Backend workflow kicks in, determines and controls the movement of data to different underlying components as configured in the workflow process. Rights are checked before processing the request.</blockquote></blockquote>

			<blockquote><blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>
			<p><b>Use-Case#5</b></p>
			<p>Description: Allowed user to update the User with some specific role and access rights.</p>
			<p>Actor: Any authenticated and authorized user.</p>
